# Introduction of Common Spatial Pattern(CSP) Algorithm

Common spatial pattern (CSP) is a spatial filtering algorithms commonly used in the field of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), especially in the classification of motor imagery paradigms, which is one of the benchmark algorithms for motor imagory paradigms. 

Currently, the development of CSP has slowed down. Nevertheless, this algorithm still have revelation to the development of BCI. We will start from original CSP algorithm, and tries to elucidate the connection between the mathematical ideas and neuroscience.

The purpose of Common Spatial Pattern Algorithm: Design a linear transform, which can also be called as spatial filter, mapping the original data into a new space which is more discriminative
