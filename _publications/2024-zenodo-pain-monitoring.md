This continuous pain rating task assesses pain intensity using the open-source software PsychoPy hosted on Pavlovia. At the start, participants are provided with detailed instructions and asked to complete a short practice run to ensure they understood how the application worked. Once this is completed, participants continuously rated their pain for approximately five minutes on a vertical scale ranging from "Least Pain" to "Most Pain."
