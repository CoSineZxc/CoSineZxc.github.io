A brain-computer interface (BCI) based on motor imagery (MI) translates human intentions into computer commands by recognizing the electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns of different imagination tasks. However, due to the scarcity of MI commands and the long calibration time, using the MI-based BCI system in practice is still challenging. Zero-shot learning (ZSL), which can recognize objects whose instances may not have been seen during training, has the potential to substantially reduce the calibration time. Thus, in this context, we first try to use a new type of motor imagery task, which is a combination of traditional tasks and propose a novel zero-shot learning model that can recognize both known and unknown categories of EEG signals. This is achieved by first learning a non-linear projection from EEG features to the target space and then applying a novelty detection method to differentiate unknown classes from known classes. Applications to a dataset collected from nine subjects confirm the possibility of identifying a new type of motor imagery only using already obtained motor imagery data. Results indicate that the classification accuracy of our zero-shot based method accounts for 91.81% of the traditional method which uses all categories of data.
