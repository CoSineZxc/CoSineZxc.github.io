I am a Research Assistant at the [Centre for Neuroscience in Education (CNE)](https://www.cne.psychol.cam.ac.uk/) at University of Cambridge. Before joining CNE, I received my MPhil degree in Psychology from the University of Cambridge. I received my bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science at Tongji University.

My current research is mainly about the Development of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) for Developmental Language Disorder. My research interest is mainly about Brain Computer Interface and the clinical use of machine learning algorithms with neuroimaging data.
